# Project definitions

Project definitions are stored at `./stackhead/[projectname].yml` (per default).
However that can be overwritten by setting the `stackhead__remote_config_folder` in inventory file.
Each file consists of a **domain** and an **application configuration**.

There are two application types: docker and web. Only one application type is allowed.

## Application Type: docker (recommended)

Docker-based applications are applications that run in one or multiple Docker containers.
The definition is pretty similar to docker-compose. In fact StackHead uses docker-compose to spin up the containers.

**Note:** We're using **version 2.8** of Docker Compose, however not all container options are supported right now.

The example below consists of two services (app and db).

```yaml
---
domain: example.com
deployment:
  type: docker
  settings:
    expose:
      port: 80
      service: app
    services:
      app:
        image: nginxdemos/hello:latest
      db:
        image: mariadb:10.5
        environment:
          MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
```
### expose

The Nginx webserver will proxy all web traffic to the service and port specified in `expose` setting.

In the example above, Nginx will proxy web requests to the "app" container's port 80.

### services

#### image (required)

See [docker-compose documentation on image](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#image)

#### volumes

See [docker-compose documentation on volumes](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#volumes).

#### environment

See [docker-compose documentation on environment](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v2/#environment).

#### links

See [docker-compose documentation on links](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/#links).

## Application Type: web

Web-based applications are basic applications that live on the target machine and are served by the Nginx webserver.

```yaml
---
domain: example.com
deployment:
  type: web
```

### Serve location

Per default files are served from the `htdocs` folder inside the `/var/www/[projectname]/` directory.
If you want to serve files from a different folder inside that directory, use `deployment.settings.public_path` as below.

```yaml
---
domain: example.com
deployment:
  type: web
  settings:
    public_path: public
```

### Capabilities

If your application requires other software or runtime environments,
define capabilities using `deployment.settings.capabilities` to make sure the application
is only deployed to targets that meet the requirements.

```yaml
---
domain: example.com
deployment:
  type: web
  settings:
    capabilities:
      php:
        version: 7.3
```

Please also have a look at the [complete list of available capabilities](../Features/Capabilities.md).
