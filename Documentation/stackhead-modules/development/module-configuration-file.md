# Module configuration file

The module configuration file `stackhead-module.yml` is a YAML file that can have the following settings.

### type

The type of your module \(webserver or container\). While your are currently not required to set this attribute, we recommend you to do so.

### terraform

Using the `provider` setting the required Terraform provider can be specified. If set, they will be installed during server setup.

`name` is the actual name of the Terraform provider. Going by Terraform conventions a binary file is called `terraform-provider-[name]` with `[name]` being the actual name required in this setting.

`url` points to the path where the binary file is being downloaded from.

```yaml
---
terraform:
  provider:
    name: caddy # binary created will be called terraform-provider-caddy
    url: https://github.com/getstackhead/terraform-caddy/releases/download/v1.0.0/terraform-provider-caddy
```
