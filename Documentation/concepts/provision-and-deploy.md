title: Provision & Deploy
---

When using StackHead you'll come upon two words:
Server **provisioning** and project **deployment**.

### Server provisioning

Any system you want to use StackHead on has to be **provisioned** first.
This will install all required software packages and services onto the target system.

Find out how to provision your server in the [Getting started guide](../introduction/getting-started.md).

### Project deployment

Getting your own application on the provisioned server is called **deployment**.
This will setup the required web server configurations, SSL certificates and application for your project.

Find out how to deploy to your provisioned server in the [Getting started guide](../introduction/getting-started.md).
