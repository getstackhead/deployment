Projects consist of your application and a host domain where your application can be reached.  
The information about a project is stored in the **project definition** file.

While we recommend running your application in a Docker container,
you can also set it up to run directly on the target system.
Please have a look at the [project definition documentation](../ProjectDefinition.md) for more information.
